Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

Project Name: sensorMaintainence

This project aims to predict the maintenance needs of industrial sensors using machine learning techniques. By analyzing sensor data, the system can anticipate failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and reducing maintenance costs.

Overview

Domain: Predictive Maintenance / Industrial IoT  
Goal: Predict when a sensor is likely to fail and schedule preventive maintenance  
Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter, Flask (optional UI)

Problem Statement

Sensors are critical to industrial operations. Unexpected sensor failures can lead to halted production lines, increased costs, and safety risks. This project leverages machine learning to forecast sensor failures in advance using historical and real-time data.

Dataset

Includes:
- Sensor ID
- Timestamp
- Operational settings
- Sensor metrics like vibration, pressure, temperature
- Failure status label (0 = healthy, 1 = failure)

Dataset source: public datasets or synthetic simulations

Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize and scale data
   - Feature engineering

2. Model Training
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine
   - XGBoost

3. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

- Sensor failure heatmaps
- Optional real-time dashboard for alerts

Results

Model             | Accuracy | F1-Score | ROC-AUC
------------------|----------|----------|---------
Random Forest     | 93%      | 0.91     | 0.94
Logistic Regression | 89%    | 0.87     | 0.90
XGBoost           | 94%      | 0.92     | 0.96
